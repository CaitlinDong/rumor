\title{Trend or No Trend: A Novel Nonparametric Method for Classifying Time Series}

\author{Stanislav Nikolov}
% If you wish to list your previous degrees on the cover page, use the 
% previous degrees command:
%       \prevdegrees{A.A., Harvard University (1985)}
% You can use the \\ command to list multiple previous degrees
%       \prevdegrees{B.S., University of California (1978) \\
%                    S.M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1981)}

\prevdegrees{S.B., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2011)}

\department{Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}

% If the thesis is for two degrees simultaneously, list them both
% separated by \and like this:
% \degree{Doctor of Philosophy \and Master of Science}
\degree{Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}

% As of the 2007-08 academic year, valid degree months are September, 
% February, or June.  The default is June.

%% By default, the thesis will be copyrighted to MIT.  If you need to copyright
%% the thesis to yourself, just specify the `vi' documentclass option.  If for
%% some reason you want to exactly specify the copyright notice text, you can
%% use the \copyrightnoticetext command.  
%\copyrightnoticetext{\copyright IBM, 1990.  Do not open till Xmas.}

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command
% once for each.
\supervisor{Prof. Devavrat Shah}{Jamieson Career Development Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}

\cosupervisor{Dr. Satanjeev Banerjee}{Engineer, Twitter Inc.}

% This is the department committee chairman, not the thesis committee
% chairman.  You should replace this with your Department's Committee
% Chairman.
\chairman{Prof. Dennis M. Freeman}{Chairman, Masters of Engineering Thesis Committee}

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.
\cleardoublepage
% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.
% \pagestyle{empty}
\setcounter{savepage}{\thepage}
\begin{abstractpage}
\input{abstract}
\end{abstractpage}

% Additional copy: start a new page, and reset the page number.  This way,
% the second copy of the abstract is not counted as separate pages.
% Uncomment the next 6 lines if you need two copies of the abstract
% page.
% \setcounter{page}{\thesavepage}
% \begin{abstractpage}
% \input{abstract}

\section*{Acknowledgments}
This thesis would not have been possible without my advisor Devavrat Shah. I
would like to express my deepest gratitude to Devavrat for his patience, for his
breadth and depth of technical knowledge, for his infectious enthusiasm, and for
teaching me the virtues of simplicity and optimism --- all the way back to his
warm response to my cold email.

I would also like to thank my co-advisor Bano Banerjee for invaluable
brainstorming, discussions, and advice when I was starting out. His advice on
how to choose a topic and how to conduct good research in general will stay with
me. Thanks also for taking over my projects so I could focus on my thesis.

Many thanks are due to Judy Cheong, for always being cheerful, and for
heroically handling the mountain of paperwork needed for me to stay at Twitter;
to Ben Lee, for taking time out of fighting the good fight to make sure we don't
do anything illegal; to Frank Lin, for emphasizing the ``why'' over the ``what'';
and to Ram Ravichandran for his intimate knowledge of the structure of retweet
activity preceding a trend.

Special thanks are in order to Andy Schlaikjer and Jeff Dalton for many
brainstorming sessions, discussions, coffee runs, and adventures. Their
experience and technical knowledge helped me come up with a topic and influenced
the way I think about research and academia.

A big thank you to Mark Tobenkin for his endless curiosity and for his uncanny
ability to walk into my office at just the right time to help me with control
theory problems. If not for him, I might still be finishing my final projects rather
than this thesis.

Thank you to my friends, for always being there; to my mother, father and
brother, for everything.
