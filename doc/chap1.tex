\chapter{Introduction}

A signal and a signal detection method.

Assumptions:

Events worthy of detection are correlated with localy burstiness in the network. Even if those users around whom there is most activity didn't CAUSE the popularity of the event, the fact there is some big event INDUCES nonuniformity in the spreading of the information. Example: Some earthquake happens. People go on twitter to check realtime news. They disproportionately retweet a few people.
